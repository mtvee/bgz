Bugz is a simple command line bug tracking tool written in python. It uses
ascii text files (actually pickles at the moment) to keep a database of 
bugs so it can live in the source tree of the project and become part of 
the versioning system.

Installing
----------
Unfold the archive or checkout the source tree and type:

$> sudo python setup.py install

to install or you can just 

$> chmod +x ./bgz

and run it in place.

Now you can run 'bgz --help' from the root of your source tree and 
possibly figure out the rest. Reading the source may help or hinder.

Config
------
~/.bugzrc
--[snip]--
# comment
; another comment

editor=vi

Running
-------
Bugz will walk up the directory tree to find its files so you can run it 
from anywhere in the tree.
