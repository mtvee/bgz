Bugz is a simple command line bug tracking tool written in python. It uses
ascii text files to keep a database of bugs so it can live in the source
tree of the project and become part of the versioning system.

Installing
----------
Unfold the archive and type:

$> sudo python setup.py install

Now you can run 'bugz --help' from the root of your source tree and figure
out the rest.

Config
------
~/.bugzrc
--[snip]--
# comment
; another comment
user=your name
email=me@someplace.com
editor=vi
--[snip]--

Running
-------
Bugz will walk up the directory tree to find its files so you can run it 
from anywhere in the tree.


TODO
----
[x] - have a ~/.bugzrc file for user info, etc
[x] - walk up the path to find the .bugz dir, git like
[ ] - have editor configurable from rc
